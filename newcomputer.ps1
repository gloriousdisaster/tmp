.SYNOPSIS
  A PowerShell script to automatically enable Hyper-V, WSL 2, and VirtualMachinePlatform,
  install Debian WSL, and install various applications via winget. If a reboot is required,
  it creates a one-time Scheduled Task to resume the script automatically after the system
  restarts.

.DESCRIPTION
  1. Ensures the script runs with Administrator privileges.
  2. Checks Windows version to ensure WSL 2 compatibility (Windows 10 19041+ or Windows 11).
  3. Enables the following Windows features if not already enabled:
     - Hyper-V
     - Windows Subsystem for Linux
     - VirtualMachinePlatform
  4. If any feature changes require a restart, creates a one-time Scheduled Task that runs
     this script automatically on system startup with SYSTEM privileges. Then reboots.
  5. After reboot, the script resumes:
     - Sets the default WSL version to 2.
     - Installs Debian WSL if not already installed.
     - Installs applications via winget (logs output to a file on the Desktop).
  6. Removes the Scheduled Task when complete so it does not run on every startup.

IMPORTANT 
  Computers with VScode Installed
  Visual Studio Code Remote Tunnels are a legitimate feature that enables remote
  access to endpoints. For threat actors - VSCode tunnels enable them to bypass 
  security protocols, facilitating lateral movement and data exfiltration.

  To prevent this on a single computer, add the following to the host file.
  # C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc

  0.0.0.0     tunnels.api.visualstudio.com
  0.0.0.0     devtunnels.ms
